# Matlab_MLP_BackProp
A Neural Network is coded  in the simplest form possible and also backpropagation is used for training. Can be used for educational purposes.

Momentum is NOT added to the code to keep it simple enough to read.

TODO:
1. I'll add another file to show MLP with momentum
2. A generalized version of MLP BP with momentum will be added when I have time...

Model will be trained with kaggle data to guess hearth attack possibility.
